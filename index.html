          I am currently working to help The Council for Sustainable Healing
          create a product line that brings mental wellness resources to the
          public at a low-cost or no-cost entry. I work to create stakeholder
          consensus, educate about non-profit governance, as well as perform
          market analysis and UX research. I am also mentoring content creators
          to tell their stories of recovery.

          Previously I owned and ran a small private therapy practice for many
          years where I focused on couples and families and those who have
          experienced trauma. I also managed the day to day functions of running
          the business including business assessment and strategy, marketing
          analysis, user experience, compliance and training, contracting and
          procurement, and project and work flow planning.

          Teaching at an online higher education institution was something I
          also enjoyed as I worked with students to encourage them to reach
          their potential instead of doing the minimum required. I was able to
          help them see how working to upgrade their skills would benefit them
          in the long run and mentored multiple students into their chosen
          school for graduate work.

        <p>
          My mom was a computer programmer in the 70s for the state of Missouri.
          She used punch cards to run the payroll for the state and broke down
          barriers to women in tech even back then. She made sure that we always
          had a computer in the home for us to learn those skills and understand
          how they work. I grew up learning how to do basic coding when I was 10
          and did my first big programming project in high school on an Apple
          2e. :)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I taught computer fundamentals, MS Office and database fundamentals at
          a community college in my early 20s and then decided that people and
          how they worked was more interesting. So I finished my undergrad and
          graduate degrees in Marriage and Family Therapy. I owned a private
          therapy practice since graduate school where I focused on treating
          couples and families, and individuals dealing with trauma.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          As I have transitioned back into the tech world, I have become
          enamored with blockchain and NFTs. The possibilities for using these
          in the current world and future are so very exciting to me both from a
          business and creative point of view.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          In my personal life, I love playing pickleball, crafting, trying out
          new restaurants with friends, and exploring National Parks.
